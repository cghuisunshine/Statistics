  <h1>Experiments and Observational Studies – Chapter 10 Tutorial</h1>

  <section id="10-1">
    <h2>10.1 Observational Studies</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Observational studies record choices/outcomes without assigning treatments; cannot establish causation because of lurking variables.</li>
      <li>Retrospective: look back at existing data/records; Prospective: follow subjects forward in time.</li>
      <li>Useful for rare outcomes or when experiments are impractical/unethical; prone to confounding and limited control.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Music students vs. grades:</strong> Retrospective comparison shows higher grades for music students, but differences could be due to preexisting habits/support, not music itself.</li>
      <li><strong>Pet kidney failure investigation:</strong> Retrospective study of affected animals’ diets/exposures to identify possible causes.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="10-2">
    <h2>10.2 Randomized, Comparative Experiments</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Experiments deliberately assign treatments to subjects (experimental units) to test cause/effect.</li>
      <li>Principles: Control what you can, Randomize the rest, Replicate (enough units), Block when feasible.</li>
      <li>Factor: explanatory variable; Levels: specific values of a factor; Treatment: combination of factor levels.</li>
      <li>Random assignment balances lurking variables across groups, enabling causal inference.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sleep/exercise on grades:</strong> Randomly assign students to 4/6/8 hrs sleep × 0/30 min exercise; compare grade outcomes.</li>
      <li><strong>Contrast bath study:</strong> Randomized, controlled comparison of contrast baths +/– exercise vs. exercise alone to assess swelling reduction.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="10-3">
    <h2>10.3 Blinding and Control</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Blinding reduces bias: subjects, evaluators (or both) unaware of treatment assignments (single vs. double-blind).</li>
      <li>Control group provides a baseline (placebo or standard treatment) to compare active treatments.</li>
      <li>Placebos mimic treatment experience to isolate treatment effect from expectation effects.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Vitamin E post-surgery:</strong> Use placebo ointment vs. vitamin E ointment with blinded patients and assessors to measure healing speed.</li>
      <li><strong>Shingles ointment trial:</strong> Randomize 8 patients to new vs. standard ointment; blinding limited but placebo-like control helps reduce bias.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="10-4">
    <h2>10.4 Blocking and Factorial Designs</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Block on known nuisance variables (e.g., gender, severity) to reduce variability and isolate treatment effects within homogeneous groups.</li>
      <li>Factorial designs vary multiple factors simultaneously to study main effects and interactions efficiently.</li>
      <li>Randomize within blocks; keep treatment allocation balanced across blocks.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Frumpies cereal preference:</strong> If Saturday-cartoon viewers might respond differently, block by viewing status when testing old vs. new flavour.</li>
      <li><strong>Two pesticides in corn plots:</strong> Apply both pesticides across many plots; randomize within blocks (e.g., field sections) to compare effectiveness.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="10-5">
    <h2>10.5 Confounding &amp; Causal Claims</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Confounding: when effects of a factor and another variable are intertwined; observational studies especially vulnerable.</li>
      <li>Only well-designed randomized experiments justify causal conclusions; observational studies suggest associations/hypotheses.</li>
      <li>Statistical significance ≠ causation; consider design, control, and potential confounders before claiming cause.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Wine and health:</strong> Observational studies show wine drinkers healthier, but wealth/education lurk; cannot claim wine causes better health.</li>
      <li><strong>Weekend hospital deaths:</strong> Observational finding of higher weekend mortality; possible confounders include staffing levels, case severity.</li>
    </ul>
